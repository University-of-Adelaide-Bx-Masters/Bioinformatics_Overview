# Markdown naming convention for prac materials

This course contains three modules:

- Fundamentals of Bioinformatics 
- Pathogens and Metagenomics
- Reproducible Bioinformatics

All practical materials should be placed within the associated module. 

Practical markdown files should be named as `prac_number_descriptor.md`.

For example, the second bash practical would be called `prac_2_bash.md`.

Numbering starts from 1 within each module.
